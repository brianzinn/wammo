> a force directed graph solver built for 2D & 3D.

"Why Avoided Making My Own" js physics engine (named after AMMO.js)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing

This project has not yet been optimized - currently in a more academic state with aim for readability and ease to use different pluggable algorithms (even at runtime).

Have a working babylon.js physics engine plugin that will be published soonish hopefully with a demo
